# Rubiks Slider Benchmark

The benchmark is designed to measure a model's ability to handle problems with many interdependent parts, where the consequences of actions are not always immediately clear. Aiming to answer the question: Does it understand the affects of its actions while problem solving? Unlike tasks that can be solved by breaking them into independent subproblems, Rubiks Slider requires a holistic understanding of the entire state at all times. By observing model performance on this task, we hope to gain insight into their capacity for global reasoning and long horizon planning in environments with deeply entangled states.
